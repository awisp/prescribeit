# PrescribeIt

## Inspiration
A few months ago, we visited our grandparents. Since they are very elderly and suffer from many chronic illnesses, such as high blood pressure, they need to regularly take medicine to preserve their health. However, they have a lot going on and do not always remember to take their medicine or renew their prescriptions. We know that many other elderly people experience the same thing, so we came up with PrescribeIt. 
## What it does
PrescribeIt reminds you to take your medication by sending a push notification to your phone at the time you have set to take your medicine. The app also can automatically refill and renew your prescription. You may already be able to refill your prescription with the Walgreens or CVS app, but neither of them can renew your prescription. At the touch of a button, PrescribeIt sends a message to your doctor requesting a renewed prescription, who sends a prescription to your pharmacy, who sends your medicine directly to you.
There are many ways to sync your prescriptions to PrescribeIt. One way would be to manually enter your information, including your pharmacy, your doctor's information, and your prescriptions. Another way would be to log in to your pharmacy account on the app, and the app automatically syncs your information. The final, and easiest way to sync your prescriptions would be to scan your medicine bottle with the app, and it would automatically enter your information.
## How we built it
This app was built with React Native and is connected with external APIs from CVS and Walgreens. In the future, the app will also be connected with doctors via phone and text message.
## Challenges we ran into
We don't need to take prescribed medicine, so we had to reach out to our grandparents and people we knew who did in order to understand what
The android emulator we were using to test the app couldn't connect to the JS server, and it took a lot of time to fix, delaying the development of the prototype.
We were not given enough time to create a perfect prototype from the ground up.
## Accomplishments that we're proud of
Over the span of less than two days, we managed to write a working prototype app using React Native.
## What we learned
We now know how to use React Native, and also understand how the renewal of pharmaceutical drugs works.
## What's next for PrescribeIt
In the future, we will complete the app by connecting it with external APIs from CVS and Walgreens and adding new features. After it is complete, we will work on publishing the app on the Google Play Store and App Store.
